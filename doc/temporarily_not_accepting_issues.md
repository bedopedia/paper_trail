# Temporarily Not Accepting Issues

March, 2019

Pull requests are still welcome.

We've had trouble recently with people refusing to follow the [Issue
Templates](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).

Issues are temporarily disabled while we discuss, as a team, how to handle
this problem.

Unfortunately, GitHub does not seem to offer a way of disabling the *creation*
of new issues without also hiding existing issues.
